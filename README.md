Hello! I make stuff. **LOTS** of stuff.
# What I Do
I am a completely self-taught branch of [Gozar Productions](https://gozarproductions.com) that makes tools to aid in the use of various programs. If there's something I think a program should do, and I see the functionality doesn't exist, I make it. And then I share it for others to use too.
# My Projects
My tools range from Discord Bots to Obsidian plugins to VR aids. I make more stuff as I get involved in more stuff. And then I make that stuff free for anyone to use.

Here are some of my projects:
## Obsidian Things
- [**Diarian**](https://github.com/Erallie/diarian) – All-in-one journaling toolkit.
- [**Colored Candy**](https://github.com/Erallie/colored-candy) – A cute lil' theme based on your accent color.
- [**Discord Timestamps**](https://github.com/Erallie/discord-timestamps) – Displays discord timestamps in read mode as they would appear in Discord.
- [**CSS Inserter**](https://github.com/Erallie/css-inserter) – Inserts user-defined css snippets into the selected text.
## Discord Bots
- [**Voicely Text**](https://github.com/Erallie/voicely-text) – A discord bot that speaks text from a voice text channel in the associated voice channel using text to speech.
- [**Voicely Ping**](https://github.com/Erallie/voicely-ping) – Set up pings when a voice reaches a certain amount of participants
## VR Tools
- [**XS Notify**](https://github.com/Erallie/xs-notify) – Sends windows notifications to XSOverlay
## Minecraft Plugins
- [**DiscordNickSync**](https://github.com/Erallie/discord-nick-sync) – Syncs your Discord nickname to your essentials nickname via DiscordSRV
